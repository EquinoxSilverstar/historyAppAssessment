The Aging History !: A Educational Mobile application

In this report, it details the main purpose, design considerations, and the carrying out of the Aging History. A mobile app that is designed to engage students with the history of well known historical figures we all love such as Nelson Mandela, Jesus Christ, Bruce Lee and many others just by inputting your age from 20 to 100 to get a brief history of what that historical figure and when they have done in their lives to be so historically known from their deaths. The report also explores a version control because of the potential utilisation of GitHub and GitHub actions which has given a automated testing in the assessment. The design considerations has enhanced the app to have age input resilience that allows the students to use the app's features, giving them a option to enter their age to receive a output result of the age input they have provided. Although there is a limit to age range increase, which starts from 20 to 100 for each mysterious historical figure. If that condition is not met , then a error handling I added will make the app execute a error Handling to showcase that it is invalid age input, for example, if ages are outside 20 to 100 range. Although I still provide a clear and informed error text view or messages which leads the students towards putting the right valid input of the figures from 20 to 100. This can also match the name of each historical figure, such as showcasing an interesting historical background about the figure to enlighten the continuation of the student to explore the user friendly experience, making history learning likable and open for access. The app will ignite students' interests by the comparison of their favourite historical figures and with understandable age milestones. This will make students gain a enjoyable understanding of these figures that will display when generated. I recommend teachers from private institutions, public schools and online courses to inform their students about The Aging History app because of how much it will be a useful tool to use to remember each event of history quicker. Here's an Aging History App step by step guide for students to learn how to get and use the Aging History app. We will outline how students can effectively learn from the Aging History app and maximize their educational experience.

Through exploration, reflection, and discussion, students can gain a deeper understanding of the past and its relevance to the present day. As they journey through history with the Aging History app, students will develop critical thinking skills, cultural awareness, and a lifelong appreciation for the richness of human history. The programming language to create thins possible application was using Kotlin. Definitely suited for this development fo the assessment. Special thanks to GitHub and GitHub Actions for making the integration possible by carrying out the Kotlin code of the aging History App into developed stage. The GitHub and GitHub actions can completely upgrade the assessment's maintenance and efficiency for a long run because I researched within the GitHub.com in the information's and http://stackoverflow.com/questions that has provided me the answers about how GitHub works in programming world. What I noticed that it improved my code quality by testing the units written using frameworks like JUnit can be integrated with GitHub Actions to verify the app's functionalities automatically, helping maintain the code's quality and prevents regressions because new features are has been added. GitHub basically provides a central location for code storage and utilizing Git controls within Android Studio that will allow the developers to keep track of changes like manage development branches. The GitHub Actions can also be set up to automatically run tests as it is said to be powerful automation as it is said to be powerful automation tool but code is committed to the repository.

In conclusion Aging History has potential to be useful to students as educational tool. By merging the user interface with well structured age comparison mechanic, that makes you enjoy learning about the history. The references I used for history of the historical figures is Britannia.com and Https//www.gcis.gov.za. where I have found accessable sources such as marve.code.fix.com and IIE SharePoint IMAD manual module to refer back to notes that makes the app run accordingly. This is also the link to my YouTube video on how the app runs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyLITGZQ50U&error=0in this video presentation I showcase how it works as I fully brief believable outcome of each output.
