The Aging History: An Educational Mobile application 

In this report, it details the main purpose, design considerations, and the carrying out of the Aging History. A mobile app that is designed to engage students with the history of well-known historical figures we all love such as Nelson Mandela, Jesus Christ, Bruce Lee and many others just by inputting your age from 20 to 100 to get a brief history of what that historical figure and what they have done in their lives to be so historically known from their deaths.  There are some examples of what it would display, which the switch statements will demonstrate.

This then directs the age to the historical figure list within the switch statement of numbers from 20 to 100.  

The report also explores version control because of the potential utilization of GitHub and GitHub actions which has given an automated testing in the assessment. The design considerations have enhanced the app to have age input resilience that allows the students to use the app's features, giving them an option to enter their age to receive an output result of the age input they have provided. Although there is a limit to age range increase, which starts from 20 to 100 for each mysterious historical figure. If that condition is not met, then an error handling I added will make the app execute a error Handling to showcase that it is invalid age input, for example, if ages are outside 20 to 100 range.

This is a number that is way lower than 20 and is displayed as the same error as the one on right hand side that shows 900 greater than 100. Giving us an invalid message to tell us that it's wrong and needs the right ages. I also provided a clear and informed error in the text view which leads the students towards putting the right valid input of the figures from 20 to 100. If they ever think of putting incorrect values such as twenty-three or %$^ undeclared valuables. This will motivate them to try again with integers  

 

 

. This can also match the name of each historical figure, such as showcasing an interesting historical background about the figure to enlighten the continuation of the student to explore the user friendly experience, making history learning likable and open for access. The app will ignite students' interests by the comparison of their favorite historical figures and with understandable age milestones. This will make students gain an enjoyable understanding of these figures that will display when generated. I recommend teachers from private institutions, public schools and online courses to inform their students about The Aging History app because of how much it will be a useful tool to use to remember each event of history quicker. Here's an Aging History App step by step guide for students to learn how to get and use the Aging History app. We will outline how students can effectively learn from the Aging History app and maximize their educational experience. 

Step 1: They must download and install the app from our website or on the online stores. Simply search for "Aging History" on the website and follow the prompts to download and install the app on your mobile device. 

Step 2: Launch the app and once the app is installed, tap on the app icon to launch it. You will see the app's main screen, which features an age input field and two buttons: Generate and Clear for your enter age input 

Step 3: Then enter your age into the enter age field. You can type in your age manually. Make sure to input your age accurately to receive the most relevant historical information. 

Step 4: Explore historical figures and after entering your age, tap on the generate here button to generate information about a historical figure who lived around the same age as you. The app will display the name of the historical figure and a brief description of their death and their accomplishments. 

Step 5: Read the Historical Information. Take your time to read and explore the information provided about the historical figure. Also learn about their achievements, contributions to society, and the impact they had on the world during their lifetime. Pay attention to key events and milestones in their life that shaped their legacy. 

Step 6: Take advantage of these features to further brace yourself in the history of the selected figure. Watch videos and listen to speeches to gain a deeper understanding of their story after engaging with this app. 

Step 7: Reflect on what you have learned about the historical figure and make connections to your own life and experiences. Think about how their achievements and challenges relate to contemporary issues and events. Think critically about the lessons that can be drawn from their life and apply them to your own journey. 

Step 8: Share your discoveries and insights with friends, family, and classmates. Engage in discussions about history, exchange ideas, and learn from each other's perspectives. Encourage others to download the Aging History app and embark on their own journey of historical life. 

Step 9: Continuously learn and grow and finally, remember that learning is a lifelong journey. Continue to use the Aging History app as a tool for exploration. Challenge yourself to delve deeper into history, ask questions, and seek answers. By embracing curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, you can continue to learn and grow with each new historical figure you just encounter. The Aging History app provides students with a dynamic and interactive platform for learning about history. 

By following these step-by-step instructions, students can effectively engage with the app's features and maximize their educational experience. Through exploration, reflection, and discussion, students can gain a deeper understanding of the past and its relevance to the present day. As they journey through history with the Aging History app, students will develop critical thinking skills, cultural awareness, and a lifelong appreciation for the pure memory lane of human history. The programming language to create this possible application was Kotlin. Definitely suited for this development for the assessment. Special thanks to GitHub and GitHub Actions for making the integration possible by carrying out the Kotlin code of the aging History App into developed stage. The GitHub and GitHub actions can completely upgrade the assessment's maintenance and efficiency for a long run because I researched within the http://GitHub.com in the information pages and http://stackoverflow.com/questions that has provided me the answers about how GitHub works, the use of switch statements. What I noticed that it improved my code quality by testing the units written using frameworks like JUnit can be integrated with GitHub Actions to verify the app's functionalities automatically, helping maintain the code's quality and prevents regressions because new features are has been added. GitHub basically provides a central location for code storage and utilizing Git controls within Android Studio that will allow the developers to keep track of changes like manage development branches. GitHub Actions can also be set up to automatically run tests as it is said to be powerful automation as it is said to be powerful automation tool, which the code is committed to the repository. 

In conclusion, Aging History has potential to be useful to students as an educational tool. By merging the user interfaces with well structured age comparison mechanics, that makes you enjoy learning about the history of people. 

The references: I used for history of the historical figures is Http//www.Britannia.com and Https//www.gcis.gov.za. where I have found accessible sources such as a code fixer called SinCode.com, that provided editing within my code and error removals and IIE SharePoint IMAD manual module to refer back to the notes that makes the app run accordingly. This is also the link to my YouTube video on how the app runs https://youtu.be/KppUWPT5oe8?si=zysBX6uhYJzeXj-Q this video presentation. I showcase how it works as I fully brief believable outcome of each output.
